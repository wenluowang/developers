# Android Terminals

**SDK Compatibility for Smart Terminals and mPOS Terminals**

Our single SDK seamlessly supports both smart terminals and mPOS terminals, with varying operational prototypes.

* **Smart POS:** These are highly integrated devices, allowing developers to run their apps directly on the terminal.
* **mPOS:** These terminals require connectivity with a merchant's smartphone via Bluetooth or USB to function.

Despite these operational differences, the SDK remains consistent across both types. please see detail implementation for different terminal type when [collect card payment](accept-card-payment.md)
